# OkKaraoke
An innovative online karaoke system, designed for Aidan's JCR events.

Developed using the C# language, running on top of Dot Net Core 2.1 with ASP Dot Net Core.

## Features still being worked on
- Request a song remotely using your phone, by visiting a website
- Automatically run the show: automatically announces the performers using TextToSpeech, and automatically assumes what song you would like.
- User administration: A user can moderate what songs are needed for each run (ensuring a karaoke version is chosen).

Three different views are available:
- Front end player: plays back the karaoke choices and announces who's up next
- Admin layer: allows associated song versions to be changed, and the queue to be moderated. Also allows one to stop karaoke easily.
- User layer: allows the user to pick the song, and view the queue and how long they need to wait before their song!

## Recommended development environment
On Windows, you have a choice: either Visual Studio, or Jetbrains Rider.

On Linux, Jetbrains Rider is probably the only choice, so go ahead and download that (you can get a free license from the GitHub
education pack).

Then, you'll need to manually install dotnetcore 2.1 (don't use old .NET, use the new stuff).
